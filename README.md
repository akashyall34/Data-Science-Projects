# Data-Science-Projects
Suite of Data Science and Analysis projects using MySQL, Advanced Excel, Power BI,  and Tableau.

I have finished these projects as part of my ongoing 6-month Data Science Bootcamp offered by OdinSchool (https://www.odinschool.com/). These projects demonstrate my experience with SQL, Advanced Excel, Power BI, and Tableau. I have continued to sharpen my skills by working on a Power BI project independent of the Bootcamp which is under the repo, T20_World_Cup_World).
